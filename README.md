# Project Requirements:

Users of the app are potential guests and actual guests

Guests should be able to learn all about the Wild Oasis Hotel

Guests should be able to get information about each cabin and see booked dates

Guests should be able to filter cabins by their maximum guest capacity

Guests should be able to reserve a cabin for a certain date range

Reservations are not paid online. Payments will be made at the property upon arrival. Therefore, new reservations should be set to "unconfirmed" (booked but not yet checked in)

Guests should be able to view all their past and future reservations

Guests should be able to update or delete a reservation

Guests need to sign up and log in before they can reserve a cabin and perform any operation

On sign up, each guest should get a profile in the DB

Guests should be able to set and update basic data about their profile to make check-in at the hotel faster

# TECH:

### Framework: NEXT.js

The most popular React meta-framework. Handles routing, SSR, data fetching and even remote state management (in a way...), therefore replacing many tools we had to include before

### Ul State management: Context API

### DB / API : supabase

### Styling: tailwindcss

<!-- export NODE_OPTIONS="--no-deprecation" -->
